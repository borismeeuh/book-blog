The Histories by Herodotus is regarded as one of the oldest surviving works of history and 
forms a cornerstone of Western historiography. Written in the fifth century BCE, the work 
primarily focuses on the causes and consequences of the conflicts between the Greeks and 
the Persian Empire. However, Herodotus does not limit himself to a chronological account 
of military events. Instead, he broadens his narrative with extensive descriptions of 
foreign lands, cities, landscapes, and peoples, including the Egyptians, Lydians,
Scythians, and Persians. He pays close attention to religious rituals, political systems, 
social customs, and moral values.

A defining characteristic of Herodotus’ writing style is its narrative approach. He weaves 
historical facts together with myths, legends, anecdotes, and marvelous tales that he 
collected during his travels. This gives the work a literary quality that goes beyond 
simple historical reporting. At the same time, Herodotus attempts to be critical: he 
compares different versions of events, sometimes explicitly stating which source he 
considers the most reliable, and frequently informs the reader when he doubts the truth of 
a particular account.

This combination of inquiry (historia literally means “investigation”), observation, and 
storytelling makes the work both fascinating and complex. Although his methods do not 
meet modern scientific standards, The Histories offers an unparalleled insight into the 
mindset and worldview of the ancient world. The work has influenced historians, writers, 
and philosophers for centuries and is therefore regarded not only as a historical source, 
but also as an early literary monument that marks the transition from mythological thinking 
to rational historical inquiry.
