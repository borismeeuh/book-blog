Thucydides’ *History of the Peloponnesian War* is one of the most influential historical works of classical antiquity. In this book, he gives a detailed account of the conflict between Athens and Sparta, including the political maneuvering, military strategies, and human tragedies that shaped the war.

Unlike many of his predecessors, Thucydides aimed for a rational and factual approach to history. He avoids myths and divine intervention, focusing instead on causes, consequences, and human decision-making. As a result, his work is often considered the first true attempt at scientific historiography.

The outcome is a compelling, analytical, and at times somber examination of power, democracy, ambition, and the unpredictability of war.
